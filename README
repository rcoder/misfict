README for misfict (MIcro-Serial-FICTion)
=========================================

This is a simple application designed to let you play the classic 
"story time" party game on the web. Each person sees the last line
written by someone else, and adds their own line to the story. 

Each time you write a line, you must wait for someone else to write 
one before you may contribute again. Furthermore, to read the entire 
story, you give up the right to edit for an hour.

No particular effort is made to enforce any strong security checks;
the unique ID for each user is kept in an un-obfuscated cookie, and
submitted values are not limited to a particular length. Responses
are checked to insure they have the proper sequence ID, though, to
prevent spamming + accidental re-posting.
